## Classification

For this assignment, we will be working with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models. The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` into *R* and familiarize yourself with the variables it contains using the codebook (`data/titanic_codebook.txt`).

Notice that `survived` and `pclass` should be changed to factors. When changing `survived` to a factor, you may want to reorder the factor so that *"Yes"* is the first level.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR) 
library(ISLR2) 
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)
library(corrr)
library(corrplot)
library(klaR) 
library(pROC)
set.seed(4167)
```

```
titanic <- read_csv("titanic.csv")
```

```
titanic
titanic$survived <- factor(titanic$survived)
titanic$pclass <- factor(titanic$pclass)
```

```
titan <- titanic %>% arrange(desc(survived))
```

```
titan
```

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

### Question 1

Split the data, stratifying on the outcome variable, `survived.`  You should choose the proportions to split the data into. Verify that the training and testing data sets have the appropriate number of observations. Take a look at the training data and note any potential issues, such as missing data.

```{r}
titan_split <- initial_split(titan, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = survived)
titan_train <- training(titan_split)
titan_test <- testing(titan_split)
```

```
titan_train %>% print(n = 100)
```

There exist missing data in the observations age and cabin. The missing ages would probably change our data a little bit. Some of the variables may be correlated to each other. It is a good idea to use stratified sampling as we want to focus on and group by the people who either survived (or didn't survive). There may be differences in those populations - for example, where they were staying or their age.

### Question 2

Using the **training** data set, explore/describe the distribution of the outcome variable `survived`.


```{r}
titan_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = survived)) +
  geom_bar(group = 1) 
```

Using a barplot, we see more people in the training set did not survived - approximately 60% people did not survive.

### Question 3

Using the **training** data set, create a correlation matrix of all continuous variables. Create a visualization of the matrix, and describe any patterns you see. Are any predictors correlated with each other? Which ones, and in which direction?

```{r}
cor_titan <- titan_train %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  correlate()
rplot(cor_titan) 
```

Most of the variables do not have correlation with each other. sib_sp and parch have strong positive correlation, parch and fare have a slightly positive correlation, sib_sp and fare have a very slight positive correlation, age and parch have a slightly negative correlation, and sib_sp and age have a decently negative correlation.

### Question 4

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable `survived`. Include the following predictors: ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings or spouses aboard, number of parents or children aboard, and passenger fare.

```{r}
titan_recipe <- recipe(survived ~ pclass + sex + age + sib_sp + 
                           parch + fare, data = titan_train) %>%
  step_impute_linear(age) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ starts_with("sex"):fare) %>%
  step_interact( ~ age:fare) 
```

### Question 5

Specify a **logistic regression** model for classification using the `"glm"` engine. Then create a workflow. Add your model and the appropriate recipe. Finally, use `fit()` to apply your workflow to the **training** data.

```{r}
log_reg <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
log_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(log_reg) %>% 
  add_recipe(titan_recipe)
log_fit <- fit(log_wkflow, titan_train)
log_fit %>% 
  tidy()
```


### Question 6

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a linear discriminant analysis model for classification using the `"MASS"` engine.

```{r}
lda_mod <- discrim_linear() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("MASS")
lda_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lda_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(titan_recipe)
lda_fit <- fit(lda_wkflow, titan_train)
```

### Question 7

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a quadratic discriminant analysis model for classification using the `"MASS"` engine.

```{r}
qda_mod <- discrim_quad() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("MASS")
qda_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(qda_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(titan_recipe)
qda_fit <- fit(qda_wkflow, titan_train)
```

### Question 8

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a naive Bayes model for classification using the `"klaR"` engine. Set the `usekernel` argument to `FALSE`.

```{r}
nb_mod <- naive_Bayes() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("klaR") %>% 
  set_args(usekernel = FALSE) 
nb_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(nb_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(titan_recipe)
nb_fit <- fit(nb_wkflow, titan_train)
```

### Question 9

Now you've fit four different models to your training data.

Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to generate predictions using each of these 4 models and your **training** data. Then use the *accuracy* metric to assess the performance of each of the four models.

Which model achieved the highest accuracy on the training data?

```{r}
titan_log<-predict(log_fit, new_data = titan_train, type = "prob")
titan_log_col<-bind_cols(titan_log, titan_train)
log_reg_acc<- augment(log_fit, new_data= titan_train) %>% accuracy(truth=survived, estimate=.pred_class)
log_reg_acc
```

```{r}
titan_lda<-predict(lda_fit, new_data = titan_train, type = "prob")
titan_lda_col<-bind_cols(titan_lda, titan_train)
lda_reg_acc<- augment(lda_fit, new_data= titan_train) %>% accuracy(truth=survived, estimate=.pred_class)
lda_reg_acc
```

```{r}
titan_qda<-predict(qda_fit, new_data = titan_train, type = "prob")
titan_qda_col<-bind_cols(titan_qda, titan_train)
qda_reg_acc<- augment(qda_fit, new_data= titan_train) %>% accuracy(truth=survived, estimate=.pred_class)
qda_reg_acc
```

```{r}
titan_nb<-predict(nb_fit, new_data = titan_train, type = "prob")
titan_nb_col<-bind_cols(titan_nb, titan_train)
nb_reg_acc<- augment(nb_fit, new_data= titan_train) %>% accuracy(truth=survived, estimate=.pred_class)
nb_reg_acc
```

```{r}
accuracies <- c(log_reg_acc$.estimate, lda_reg_acc$.estimate, 
                qda_reg_acc$.estimate, nb_reg_acc$.estimate)
models <- c("Logistic Regression", "LDA", "Naive Bayes", "QDA")
results <- tibble(accuracies = accuracies, models = models)
```

```{r}
results
```

The Logistic Regression model has the highest accuracy of all the models at 80.76%.

### Question 10

Fit the model with the highest training accuracy to the **testing** data. Report the accuracy of the model on the **testing** data.

Again using the **testing** data, create a confusion matrix and visualize it. Plot an ROC curve and calculate the area under it (AUC).

How did the model perform? Compare its training and testing accuracies. If the values differ, why do you think this is so?

```{r}
bind_cols(predict(log_fit, new_data=titan_test), titan_test %>% dplyr::select(survived))
bind_cols(predict(log_fit, new_data=titan_test), titan_test %>% dplyr::select(survived)) %>% accuracy(truth=survived, estimate = .pred_class)
```

```{r}
augment(log_fit, new_data = titan_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class) 
augment(log_fit, new_data = titan_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class) %>% autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

```{r}
augment(log_fit, new_data = titan_test) %>%
  roc_curve(survived, .pred_Yes) %>%
  autoplot()
pROC::auc(augment(log_fit, new_data = titan_test)$survived, augment(log_fit, new_data = titan_test)$.pred_Yes)
```
 The training and test accuracies are similar (81.56 vs 80.76%). The values differ slightly, perhaps because of overfitting in the training set, the method of measuring accuracies, and/or correlation differences between training/test data. The confusion matrix looks like it predicts the right outcome most of the time.
